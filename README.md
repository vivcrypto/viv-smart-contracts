### Local deployment

In order to deploy this code to a local testnet, you should install the npm package @viv/contracts and import bytecode imported from artifacts located at @viv/contracts/artifacts/contracts/*.json. 

For example:
```
    import {
        abi as VIV_NORMAL_ABI,
        bytecode as VIV_NORMAL_BYTECODE,
    } from '@viv/contracts/artifacts/contracts/trades/VivNormal.sol/VivNormal.json'
```
This will ensure that you are testing against the same bytecode that is deployed to mainnet and public testnets, and all viv code will correctly interoperate with your local deployment.

### Using solidity interfaces

```
import '@viv/contracts/trades/VivNormal.sol';

contract MyContract {
  VivNormal trans;

  function doSomethingWithNormal() {
    // trans.purchase;
  }
}
```
